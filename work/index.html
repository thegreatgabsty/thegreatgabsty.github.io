						<div class="project-copy">
								<p><span style="color:red;">This summer I had the amazing opportunity to be one of the first design interns at Stripe!</span><br><br>I was on the Brand & Communications team and worked on lots of consumer-facing brand assets as well as materials for internal company use. Working at Stripe was truly one of the most life-changing experiences I have had thus far as a designer and as a person (not that the two are mutually exclusive).</p>
							</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg" src="projects/stripe/cover.jpg">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Stripe Communities Rebrand</span><br><br>The first project I worked on was the rebrand of the Stripe Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to Stripe Communities! For this project I was assigned to design 2 of the 9 logos (and later jumped on a third). I worked on the East & Southeast Asians logo and the Rainbows (LGBTQ) logo.</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/erg.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">East & Southeast Asians</span><br><br>For this logo I did tons of research into "asian" symbolism and imagery. A huge potential issue I wanted to avoid with this logo was making it too specific to one type of Asian or making it too stereotypical (a dragon, a yin-yang sign, things that are too generically east asian).<br><br>My first few ideas were to approach the subject typographically, geographically, as an identity, or with food.</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/esea-ideation.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">East & Southeast Asians</span><br><br>Then my epiphany hit. ESEA should be represented by an activity we all share: eating! Not just a graphical representation of food, but a symbol of community and eating together as a family or group. This is an important part of almost every asian culture, and I thought it best represented our entire community.<br><br>I initially had a sketch of two hands eating, but later added a third hand which spoke more to the community aspect. Each hand uses a different utensil (chopsticks and spoon are more east asian, and many southeast asians eat with their hands!).</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/esea-ideation2.png"> 
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">East & Southeast Asians</span><br><br>This is the final version of the ESEA logo with color. The color really solidifies my concept of diversity and representation which I wanted to emphasize for this cultural community.<br><br>I was personally part of this ERG during my time at Stripe and actually was part of the organizing team that planned events and kept an agenda! Which basically means we ordered boba and Beard Papas for every meeting.</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/esea-ideation3.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Rainbows</span><br><br>The Rainbows logo was much more straightforward and I came up with a few different graphic ideas.</p>
					</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/rainbows1.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Rainbows</span><br><br>After a few rounds of critique and consulting with the stakeholders (Rainbows lead members) I narrowed down to these two concepts!</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/rainbows2.png"> 
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Rainbows</span><br><br>This is the final version of the logo with color and scaled up and down in size! </p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/rainbows3.png"> 
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Desi</span><br><br>I was also able to step in and help render the logo for the Desi ERG as well! The logo is a lotus flower and leaf which represents the national flower of India. </p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/desi.png"> 
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Stripe Communities Posters</span><br><br>After my partnered designer and I finished these logos, we created posters promoting the newly rebranded Stripe Communities. We even had a Stripe Communities fair event which I helped to plan and set up!</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/posters.png"> 
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Intern Project 2: Increment</span><br><br>My second assignment was to help design spreads for the Stripe publication, Increment!</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg" src="projects/stripe/social.png"> 
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Increment Research & Ideation</span><br><br>This project was special to me because Increment was one of the reasons that prompted me to apply to Stripe in the first place!<br><br>I was supposed to lay out an interview piece for the publication. I started by researching different interview layouts and various ways of organizing information. For example, I tried a few different information hierarchies using color and indentation, to name a few.</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg" src="projects/stripe/increment-sketches.png"> 
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Increment Research & Ideation</span><br><br>These are a few different early ideas and concepts I tried out by following the Increment grid and styleguide while exercising my own creative liberties.</p>

					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/incrementB.png"> 
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/incrementC.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Increment Final Version</span><br><br>Here is what the final version I handed off looked like! You can check out the rest of the interview piece in issue 6 of Increment on the importance of Documentation which was released in August 2018!</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/incrementD.png">  
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Belgium Launch Poster</span><br><br>My most fun project was to create a country launch poster. I chose to design one for our Belgium product launch which happened back in 2017! These are some initial sketches I created during the research stage. For inspiration, I looked at different aspects of Belgium such as the national flower, colors, monuments, famous features, artists, and so forth.</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/belgium-sketch.png">
					
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/belgium-sketch2.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Belgium Launch Poster</span><br><br>My most intriguing idea was inspired by the crow-stepped gables of Belgium. They're basically recognizable buildings in Belgium that have roofs shaped like stairs!</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/belgium-sketch3.png">
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/belgium-sketch4.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Belgium Launch Poster</span><br><br>I came up with this early concept in a few different color schemes but these are the two that won.</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/belgium-posters-A.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Belgium Launch Poster</span><br><br>My manager suggested that I try a completely different approach and not get too committed to one style just yet, so I created a second version of the poster using a flat illustration style instead of isometric.</p>
						</div>
					<img class="halfBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/belgium2.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Belgium Launch Poster</span><br><br>The design team liked both versions but ultimately, I decided to go with the first one! For the final version I cropped the view a bit and tweaked the colors. This is one of my most favorite things I've ever made to date!</p>

					<img class="halfBleedImg shadow" src="projects/stripe/belgium.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Stripe is Amazing!</span><br><br>The day I started my internship at Stripe, I had no idea what a tremendous journey I had ahead of myself both as a designer and as a human being. I have met some of the most insanely talented people at this company and this internship has been one of the most fulfilling and enriching experiences of my life!<br><br>Pictured is a small portion of the summer intern cohort! I love my Stripe family!</p>

					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Stripe is Challenging!</span><br><br>The design team at Stripe is indescribably diligent and talented. This internship was one of the most challenging things I have faced as a junior designer and I have learned an invaluable amount from this team of wonderful human beings.</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg" src="projects/stripe/haha.jpg">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">We Haven't Won Yet!</span><br><br>Stripe taught me what it truly means to work smart and work hard. I had the best mentorship and guidance thanks to my wonderful mentor Tatiana Van Campenhout! Stripe truly is a special place to work and I hope to see myself in some capacity here again in the future. :)</p>

							<p><span style="color:red;">Research</span><br><br>To begin my research, I created a mind map of everything I could possibly think of that related to puppets and puppetry. Inspiration for logos and branding can come from many different angles when looking at a subject.</p>
						</div>
					<img class="fullBleedImg" src="projects/puppet/categories1.jpg">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Research</span><br><br>Next, I created a research chart. On one axis I chose five different research topics relating to puppets which I derived from my mind map: the museum itself, puppets, dolls / figurines / character creation, control, and performance/storytelling. On the other axis I put images, abstract ideas, actions, words, and materials/media. So for each box, I generated corresponding research for each type of research and each subject.</p>

					<img class="wideBleedImg" src="projects/puppet/ideation.png">
					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Direction 1</span><br><br>After ideation, I took the two most promising sketch directions and created two completely different rough identities to choose between. For the first direction, I was inspired by the hinges and strings on marionettes.</p>

					<img class="wideBleedImg" src="projects/puppet/direction1.png">
					<div class="project-copy">

					<div class="project-copy">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Final Puppet Museum Brand Guidelines</span><br><br>Finally, I got critique from the class and decided that the first direction was the most successful. I added a color palette and created a ton of brand materials and assets to make the brand feel as real as possible!</p>

							<p><span style="color:red;">Engagement Piece</span><br><br>We were also instructed to think of an engagement piece, or some sort of interactive piece related to our museum. I created Henson Hall, a hallway in the museum that would imitate people as they walked through the hall. The shadows would be calculated and animated as if they were marionettes.</p>

					<!-- OKAY DESCRIPTION -->
					<div class="overview-module" id="okayP1">
						<p><span style="color:red;">This project was created for Design For Good at RISD under the instruction of Annalisa Oswald during Wintersession 2018.</span><br><br>The Okay Club 
						is a fictional non-profit organization that I designed which supports the intersectionality of mental health. This entity would live primarily on digital media and provide resources and solidarity for marginalized individuals fighting mental illness--mainly people of color and lgbtq communities.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="overview-module" id="okayP2">
						<p><span style="color:red;">Why is it called "The Okay Club"?</span><br><br>Often times when you’re fighting mental illness,
							it’s hard to see things as anything better than just okay. And sometimes that’s okay.<br><br>I’m okay, you’re okay, we’re okay, together.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="overview-module" id="okayP3">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Mind Map</span><br><br>The first step of brainstorming was to create a mind map of what I envisioned the brand to be like--what sort of personality and qualities it had. I narrowed down to six core traits:<br><br>CALM<br>UNIQUE<br>UNCONVENTIONAL<br>FLEXIBLE<br>EMPATHETIC<br>HOPEFUL<br><br>One challenge I faced when working on this project was making approachable work about a particularly serious topic.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="overview-module" id="okayP4">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Sketches</span><br><br>I began sketching ideas for the logomark. I didn't want this brand to become kitschy or cliche (normally when you think of mental health entities, they have classic heart or brain imagery).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="overview-module" id="okayP5">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Why the Bike?</span><br><br>I had a sudden epiphany of using a bike as the logomark. On an unrelated note, I had recently watched a youtube video about the self-stablization mechanism of bikes. You see, when you push a bike forward without a rider on it, the bike may sway left and right, but ultimately given it has enough momentum it will stabilize itself.<br><br>I believe the same principle applies to people. When you're dealing with depression or anxiety, you may feel like you've lost control of the situation. You may lose your way, but as long as you keep moving forward you will not falter.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="overview-module" id="okayP6">
							<p><span style="color:red;">Iteration</span><br><br>I had some difficulty finding the right styling for the bike illustration and typeface, but after several attempts I finally ended up with something I was proud of.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="overview-module" id="okayP7">
						<p><span style="color:red;">Final Concept</span><br><br>The final concept is a penny-farthing bicycle stylized to look like an "OK". The organic lines and typeface lend a human touch.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="overview-module" id="okayP8">
						<p><span style="color:red;">Infographic</span><br><br>The last step of the assignment was to create an infographic based on data relating to our organization. I created a short booklet about mental health and marginalized communities (a quick rundown on what it means, what obstacles they face, and how we can help the cause). The bicycle is used as a metaphor throughout the book.</p>
